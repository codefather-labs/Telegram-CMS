- Pyrogram inside aiohttp with accounts connectors and easy api.
- Pyrogram listen all account updates and send it to Django.

- Most of code inside Aiohttp is asynchronous.

# v.0.2. alpha Features and notes:
- added default Trigger middleware [auto answered middlewares with usable triggers system inside django admin panel]

# v.0.3 alpha Features and notes
- updates for default Trigger middlewares [more awesome features]
- added Scenes (Scene of dialog) - now admin of django need to create Scene of dialog with user inside django admin panel. Just like need it at CMS!
- starts added state machine for Scenes
- added mode states for triggers [is_reverse_trigger, is_action, and other]
- fixed Telegram API connectors on Aiohttp. Its fully work as multi-account system
- added telegram plugin to django-admin-panel for session usage
- and more other awesome things!

# Listener Middleware Usage:
Check for your app is fully connected to telegram api. Create post.view with django rest framework, and go this way:
- from apps.telegram.middlewares import ListenerMiddleware
- listener = ListenerMiddleware()

- @api_view(['POST'])
- @listener.message
- def create_message(request):
-   ...

Now, all of incoming messages will be handle with ListenerMiddlware, wich got default functions for all kinds of messages. You should create Base scene in django admin panel and add some triggers with triggered words and answers, for Trigger Middleware handle private messages. Add groups listeners for Listener Middleware handle non private messages.

# Expectation in v.0.4. alpha:
- Finish state mahine for scenes and triggers. +
- Adding new default triggers! +
- Customize CMS API for handle AI recognition patterns ?
